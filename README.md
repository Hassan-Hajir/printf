0x11. C - printf
Description
This printf project is a collaboration between Hassan Hajir and Hulubante Tebeje. Who are Software Engineers studing at students of ALX school. This project involves a function named "_printf" which would imitate the actual "printf" command located in the stdio.h library. This function contains some of the basic features and functions found in the man 3 of "printf".

What you would learn from this project:

How to use git in a team setting
Applying variadic functions to big projects
The complexities of printf
Managing a lot of flies and finding a good workflow
Prototype
int _printf(const char *format, ...);
Usage
Prints a string to the standard output, according to a given format
All files were created and compiled on Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS using GCC 4.8.4 with the command gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra pedantic *.c
Returns the number of characters in the output string on success, -1 otherwise
Call it this way: _printf("format string", arguments...) where format string can contain conversion specifiers and flags, along with regular characters.
The format contains the string that is printed. As _printf() is variadic function, it can receives n arguments that replace by n tags written inside the string.

The format tags prototype is the following:

%[flags][length]specifier
If the program runs successfully, the return value is the amount of chars printed.

Specifier	Output
c	Character
d or i	Decimal integer
s	String
b	Binary
%	Percentage charater
o	Signed Octal
u	Unsigned Integer
x	Unsigned Hexadecimal
X	Unsigned Hexadecimal (uppercase)
p	Pointer address
r	Reversr string of characters
R	ROT13 translaton of string
S	String with special chars replaced by their ASCII value
Examples
Printing the string of chars "Hello ALX School":

Input: \_printf("Hello %s.", "ALX School");
Output: Hello ALX School
Printing an integer number:

Input: \_printf("2 + 2 is equal to %d.", 4);
Output: 2 + 2 is equal to 4
Printing a binary:

Input: \_printf("98 in binary is [%b]", 98);
Output: 98 in binary is [1100010]
File Functions
